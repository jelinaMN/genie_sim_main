# AimDK Interface protocol

## Introduction

This warehouse defines all cross-module interface protocols for AgiBot products, including external and internally circulated parts.

The root namespace of this protocol is **aimdk::protocol::**. We further divide subdirectories according to different modules and name these subdirectories and their next level namespaces after the names of these modules.
